- Added icons to application, now it looks professional *smug*
- Added menus, times to populate that About!
- I have been having so much problems getting the "Cancel" button to work on my About window...
it turned out to be that the dialog creator tool in VS2022 somehow redefined 
//#define IDCANCEL                        1002
and this was causing for the button not to work. 
- Adding Build of device list
- Adding Basic D3DInitialization and clean up.


### 🔧 Notes
- Using Windows System variables can be useful to handle include/lib paths easier!
- Now I'll work a bit on the directX side of things.

- Created the Readme for the repository! I wanted to make it pop a bit so I added a GIF and some images. 
I'm really happy to see how it ended up.

- Adding a Debug console to my empty project, since it has subsystem Windows it would normally not have a console. 
- Adding a basic Window creation, I'm playing a bit with objects trying to prepare the field to handle Window creation in a different class than DirectX. Let see how that goes.

### 🔧 Notes
- Why is so hard to align thigns on a webpage? I'm glad to not be studying webdev...
